## What is this?
Few days ago I started this project as a spin-off from [navigator-rfc])(https://github.com/ericvicenti/navigation-rfc). This repo is an implementation of the super-simple navigator behavior (without animated transitions! Please, keep it in mind).

## Motivation
To make a proof of concept for react-native navigator (based on navigator-rfc), driven by redux.

## Status
- [x] Simple navigation
- [ ] Animated transitions
